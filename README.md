<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Course Description
These courses offered by Princeton University on Coursera, is taught by _Kevin Wayne_ (Senior Lecturer) and _Robert Sedgewick_ (Professor).

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.


### [Algorithm, Part 1 (Princeton University)][algo-part-1]

* Part I focuses on elementary data structures, sorting, and searching. Topics include union−find, binary search, stacks, queues, bags, insertion sort, selection sort, shellsort, quicksort, 3-way quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, binary heaps, binary search trees, red−black trees, separate-chaining and linear-probing hash tables, Graham scan, and kd-trees. 

### [Algorithm, Part 2 (Princeton University)][algo-part-2]

* Part II focuses on graph and string-processing algorithms. Topics include depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju−Sharir, Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman−Ford, Ford−Fulkerson, LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries, Knuth−Morris−Pratt, Boyer−Moore, Rabin–Karp, regular expression matching, run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression and Burrows−Wheeler transform. Part II also introduces reductions and intractability, including the P = NP problem.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Pre-requisite

The programming prerequisite for the course is familiarity with Java, including loops, arrays, functions, recursion, and objects. The course introduced advanced features of Java as necessary (such as generics and iterators). The mathematics prerequisite is high-school algebra.

### Installation

Highly recommend to install the novice-friendly Java programming environment on your computer by following these step-by-step instructions:

* [MacOS][MacOS-install]
* [Windows][Windows-install]
* [Linux][Linux-install]
